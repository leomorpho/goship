## GoShip: Ship in Record Time ⛵️🛟⚓️📦

### A Go + HTMX boilerplate with all the essentials for your SaaS, AI tools, or web apps. Start earning online quickly without the hassle.

🎯 **The goal of this project** is to build the most comprehensive Go-centric OSS starter boilerplate to ship projects fast.

<p style="text-align:center;">Check out the video above for a rapid walkthrough of the project! 🏂</p>

This started as a fork of [pagoda](https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda), for which I am super grateful! Big shoutout to Mike Stefanello and team!

### Getting Started

To get up and running with GoShip:
```bash
# The below command will:
# - set up the postgres/redis/mailer containers
# - build the JS/CSS assets 
# - seed the DB with test users
# - start the project in watch mode
make init

# Running init will fully scrap your state and start with fresh new containers. 
# After running `make init` the first time, just use the below for everyday work.
make watch
```

For in-depth info on the architecture of the project, please see the [mikestefanello/pagoda](https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda) repo. There are some key differences, but since this was originally a fork, 99% of it still applies. I am working on creating clear and actionable documentation, but that is quite time-consuming, so don't hold your socks.

### Motivation

Build the same rich interfaces you would build with Javascript frameworks, but with HTML and Go. Limit the number of tools you use. Develop rapidly.

#### Why the Hell Do We Need Another Boilerplate?

Well, I noticed that there were none for Go. Now, I know most Go folks like to build it all themselves. And while I love doing that myself, I have many project ideas for which I just want to build that specific project, not the entire infra surrounding it, like auth, notifications, payments, file uploads etc. This project has served me well in bringing to production many projects so far. It has evolved far beyond what I originally planned for, though there is still so much potentional to expand on and implement for.

If you'd like a no-nonesense (or not too much?) starter kit to get your next project to production ASAP, while also using awesome technologies like Go, you've found a suitable starting point!

> **Warning alert!** this project is in active development as I am adding things after first trying them out in prod for [Goship](https://cherie.chatbond.app/), a relationship app to grow your couple. Note that I would welcome any help to develop this boilerplate ❤️.

# Temporary Documentation

This documentation will eventually be moved to [goship.run](https://goship.run).


## Deployment

First, make sure all your env vars in the Kamal file `deploy.yml` are correct. All your vars should be set either in:
 
- `config/config.yml`: only non-secret ones
- `deploy.yml`: only non-secret ones
- `.env`: all secret vars

Then, set the IP of the server host in `deploy.yml`, as well as your image and registry details. Read up on the [kamal documentation](https://kamal-deploy.org) if you get stuck anywhere here. 

### Set up live server

The below command will install docker, build your image, push it to your registry, and then pull it on your remote VPS. If you set up any accessory (cache, standalone DB that is not hosted etc), these will also be deployed.

```bash
kamal setup -c deploy.yml
``` 

At this point, your project should be live, and if `128.0.0.1111` is the IP of your VPS, entering that IP in the search bar on your browser should bring up your site.

### HTTPS

Hop into your VPS console.

```bash
mkdir -p /letsencrypt && touch /letsencrypt/acme.json && chmod 600 /letsencrypt/acme.json
```

Then locally, run

```bash
kamal traefik reboot
```

Your site should now have TLS enabled and you should see the lock icon the search bar.

For reference, the above procedure was taken from [this Kamal issue](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal/discussions/112).
